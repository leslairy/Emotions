# Emotions
 Project done for Creative Programming II

Throughout semester there were a lot of exploration in different fields, from face tracking to typography interactions. 
I always was interested in motion graphics and animation so my goal for the final project was to focus on it. 
I had a lot sketches to explore my new skills and I was getting different moods from each exploration. 
I decided that it will be great to show emotion by involving color, typeface, movement and meaning of the word in my work. 
Results were very interesting and I really enjoyed exlporing new techniques and getting more knowledge on the topic.
